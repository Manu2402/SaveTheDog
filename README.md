# Save The Dog
Save The Dog is a <i>2D RPG</i> video game in which the aim is to explore a small town, interacting with both NPCs and the surrounding environment, to succeed in rescuing a dog trapped in a locked house. <br>
The development time was about <b>30 days</b>.

## Development
This game was developed at the end of my first year of the “Video Game Programming” course at AIV (Accademia Italiana dei Videogiochi) as a final exam. The game was developed in C# using the “Aiv.Fast2D” and “Aiv.Audio” libraries, taking advantage of “Tiled” for making the game maps. <br>
<br>The key points of this game are as follows:
- The game scenes were made via "Tiled" by correctly parsing the XML configurations generated by it
- Point-and-click movement takes advantage of 2D pathfinding
- Scene change management
- Dialogue manager, both logic and UI side
- DarkFX in the puzzle scene

## Controls
• Left mouse click: movement<br>
• Enter: interaction
